🛒 Product Listing Website

This is a responsive product showcase website that displays a list of tech products (🎧 earbuds, 💻 laptops, 📱 tablets, 🧩 accessories) using data stored in a products.json file. Users can view product details and explore similar items based on categories.

✨ Features:

📦 JSON-based product data

🛍️ Product detail page with buy link (Amazon affiliate-friendly)

🧠 Dynamic rendering using JavaScript

📂 Category-based filtering for similar products

📱💻 Fully responsive layout (mobile-friendly)

🛠️ Tech Stack:

🌐 HTML5

🎨 CSS3

⚙️ JavaScript (Vanilla)

📄 JSON

📁 Project Structure:

index.html – Homepage

product.html – Product detail & category page

products.json – Product data

styles/style.css – Styling file

images/ – Product images (e.g., earbuds.png, projector.jpeg)

README.txt / README.md – Documentation

🔍 How It Works:

products.json contains product name, description, category, image, and buy link.

On clicking a product, JavaScript loads details dynamically using id or category.

Products of the same category are shown using filter logic.

💡 Notes:

🔗 All product images must be inside the images/ folder

✅ Make sure products.json contains correct paths and links

💰 Add your Amazon affiliate tags in the buyLink values
